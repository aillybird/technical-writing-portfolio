# A Git User Guide for Newbies

## Audience
This guide is intended for users who are very new to git and GitHub. This guide will explain the difference between the two, and how to use the git command line interface to work on your projects.

## git vs GitHub
GitHub is a website. This is a web interface for finding, organizing, and writing patches for the various projects that users have uploaded to the website.

`git` is a command on the Linux command line. If you are on a Debian-based system, you can install `git` if it is not already by running:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

`git` is available on most package management systems. Please use your distributions package manager to install an appropriate version of `git` for your system.
