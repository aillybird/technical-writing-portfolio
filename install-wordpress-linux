## Overview
This guide walks you through installing, setting up, and configuring a new WordPress website on a Debian-based Linux system with a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP) stack. By the end of this guide, you will have a functioning WordPress site running on Apache, backed by a MariaDB (MySQL-compatible) database, and ready for initial configuration through the WordPress web interface. 

## Audience
This guide is intended for more advanced Linux users who are comfortable using the command line and have basic familiarity with system administration concepts. It is suitable for:
- Developers setting up a local or remote WordPress instance
- System administrators deploying a small WordPress site
- Technical users learning how WordPress fits into a LAMP stack
- Linux hobbyists who would enjoy hosting their own website

This guide does not assume prior experience with WordPress.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, you should have:
- A Debian-based Linux system (Debian 11/12 or compatible)
- Root or sudo access
- An active internet connection
- A domain name or IP address pointing to the server (optional for local testing)

## System Requirements
- Apache 2.x
- MariaDB or MySQL
- PHP 8.x with required extensions
- At least 1 GB of RAM (2 GB recommended)
- Approximately 1 GB of available disk space

## Step 1: Update the System
Before we begin installing our new website on our linux server, a good first practice would be to apply any new system updates. This will ensure that the user is up to date with current security patches and that we are using the latest package versions available from the Debian repository. Run the following commands at the terminal window:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

Afterwards, reboot your system to load any new system software that has been installed. Note that is only strcitly neccesary if the system kernel has been updated.

`sudo reboot`

## Step 2: Install Apache
Apache is the web server that will serve content to the visitors of your website. It is highly recommended that you install Apache directly from the Debian software repository.

`sudo apt install apache2`

When installation is complete, check to see if the server is running with the following command:

`sudo systemctl status apache2`

Furthermore, you can check to see if the server is serving pages by opening a web browser and visiting the server's IP address or hostname:

`http://<server-ip>`

If Apache is installed and running correctly, you should see the Apache2 Debian Default Page. At this point, Apache is installed and ready to serve the WordPress site.

If the server is running according to systemctl but not serving pages, make sure that ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) are allowed through your firewall software. A common firewall utility for Debian is ufw and can typically be configured to allow web traffic with the following command:

`sudo ufw allow "WWW Full"`

Please note that ufw is not the default firewall software on all systems and that you may have different firewall software on your server.

## Step 3: Install MariaDB (MySQL)
Next, we will install MariaDB, the backend database for our WordPress site.

`sudo apt install mariadb-server`

Once the installation is complete, verify that the MariaDB service is running:

`sudo systemctl status mariadb`

If the service is running correctly, the status output should show active (running).

## Step 4: Secure MariaDB and Create the WordPress Database
MariaDB has a helper script that will walk you through the process of applying basic security to your database server. 

`sudo mysql_secure_installation`

During this process, you will be prompted to:

 - Set a password for the MariaDB root account
 - Remove anonymous users
 - Disable remote root login
 - Remove the test database
 - Reload privilege tables

It is recommended that you answer "yes" to each prompt unless you have a specific reason otherwise.

Next, log into the database shell as the root user:

`sudo mysql`

Then, execute the following commands, making sure to use an actual strong password:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE wordpress DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'wpuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_password_here';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'wpuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

The database and user required by WordPress are now configured.

## Step 5: Configure Apache
Next, you will configure the Apache web server.

Create a directory where you will store your files and give it the appropriate permissions:

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/example.com
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/example.com
sudo chmod 755 /var/www/example.com
```

Create a VirtualHost file in Apache for your website:

`sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com.conf`

Add the following configuration, replacing the example domain with your own domain name or server IP address:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com
    ServerAlias www.example.com

    DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com

    <Directory /var/www/example.com>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/example.com_error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/example.com_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Save the file and exit the editor. 

Next, we will issue commands to enable the new site, disable the default site, enable the rewrite module (a requirement for WordPress), and reload the Apache server. 

```
sudo a2ensite example.com.conf
sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

Again, we can check that the server is running with systemctl:

`sudo systemctl status apache2`

## Step 6: Installing PHP
WordPress is written in PHP, and requires several extensions to function properly. Thankfully the necessary software is located in the package manager:

`sudo apt install php php-mysql php-curl php-gd php-xml php-mbstring php-zip php-intl`

Once installation is complete, you can verify that PHP has been installed by running:

`php -v`

This should output the currently installed PHP version. To check that PHP is working with Apache, create a file in your web root directory

`sudo nano /var/www/example.com/info.php`

Add the following to the file:

```
<?php
phpinfo();
```

Save the file, and then change the owner so that the server can read it:

`sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/example.com/info.php`

Check the file on your web browser:

`http://<server-ip>/info.php`

If PHP is configured properly, you will see a PHP information page. Once verification is complete, it is vital that you remove this file for security purposes:

`sudo rm /var/www/example.com/info.php`
