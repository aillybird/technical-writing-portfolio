## Overview
This guide walks you through installing, setting up, and configuring a new WordPress website on a Debian-based Linux system with a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP) stack. By the end of this guide, you will have a functioning WordPress site running on Apache, backed by a MariaDB (MySQL-compatible) database, and ready for initial configuration through the WordPress web interface. 

## Audience
This guide is intended for more advanced Linux users who are comfortable using the command line and have basic familiarity with system administration concepts. It is suitable for:
- Developers setting up a local or remote WordPress instance
- System administrators deploying a small WordPress site
- Technical users learning how WordPress fits into a LAMP stack
- Linux hobbyists who would enjoy hosting their own website

This guide does not assume prior experience with WordPress.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, you should have:
- A Debian-based Linux system (Debian 11/12 or compatible)
- Root or sudo access
- An active internet connection
- A domain name or IP address pointing to the server (optional for local testing)

## System Requirements
- Apache 2.x
- MariaDB or MySQL
- PHP 8.x with required extensions
- At least 1 GB of RAM (2 GB recommended)
- Approximately 1 GB of available disk space

## Step 1: Update the System
Before we begin installing our new website on our linux server, a good first practice would be to apply any new system updates. This will ensure that the user is up to date with current security patches and that we are using the latest package versions available from the Debian repository. Run the following commands at the terminal window:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

Afterwards, reboot your system to load any new system software that has been installed. Note that is only strcitly neccesary if the system kernel has been updated.

`sudo reboot`

## Step 2: Install Apache


## Step 3: Install MariaDB (MySQL)
## Step 4: Install PHP and Required Extensions
## Step 5: Configure Apache for WordPress
## Step 6: Create the WordPress Database and User
## Step 7: Download and Configure WordPress
## Step 8: Set File Permissions
## Step 9: Complete the WordPress Installation
